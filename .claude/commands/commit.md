# Claude Command: Commit (Python/uv)

This command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji for Python projects using uv package management.

## Usage

To create a commit, just type:
```
/commit
```

Or with options:
```
/commit --no-verify
```

## What This Command Does

1. Unless specified with `--no-verify`, automatically runs pre-commit checks:
   - `pre-commit run --all-files` to run all configured hooks (ruff, bandit, etc.)
   - `uv run pytest` to run tests (if pytest is configured)
   - `uv build` to verify the package builds correctly (if applicable)
2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`
3. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
4. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed
5. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present
6. If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests breaking the commit into multiple smaller commits
7. For each commit (or the single commit if not split), creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format

## Pre-commit Hooks Integration

Your project uses the following pre-commit hooks that will be automatically run:

### Code Quality & Formatting
- **Ruff**: Linting and code formatting
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Basic file checks**: Large files, merge conflicts, TOML/YAML validation

### Git Workflow
- **Commitizen**: Ensures commit messages follow conventional format
- **Commitizen branch**: Validates branch naming on push

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform**: Format and validate Terraform files (if present)

## Best Practices for Python Commits

- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code passes ruff linting, bandit security checks, and all tests
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose
- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits
- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to dependencies, build process, tools, etc.
  - `ci`: CI/CD improvements
  - `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ✨ `feat`: New feature
  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation
  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style
  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring
  - ⚡️ `perf`: Performance improvements
  - ✅ `test`: Tests
  - 🔧 `chore`: Tooling, configuration
  - 🚀 `ci`: CI/CD improvements
  - 🏗️ `build`: Build system changes
  - 🔒️ `fix`: Fix security issues
  - 🚨 `fix`: Fix linter warnings
  - 📦️ `build`: Add or update dependencies
  - ➕ `build`: Add a dependency
  - ➖ `build`: Remove a dependency
  - 🧑‍💻 `chore`: Improve developer experience
  - 🐍 `feat`: Python-specific features
  - 🔍️ `feat`: Improve code analysis or type hints
  - 🏷️ `feat`: Add or update type annotations
  - 🧪 `test`: Add experimental tests
  - 🦺 `feat`: Add input validation or error handling
  - 📊 `feat`: Add logging, monitoring, or analytics
  - 🌍 `feat`: Environment or configuration changes
  - 🗃️ `feat`: Database-related changes
  - 🔐 `feat`: Authentication or authorization features
  - 🎯 `perf`: Optimize algorithms or data structures
  - 🧹 `refactor`: Code cleanup
  - ⚰️ `refactor`: Remove dead code
  - 🚑️ `fix`: Critical hotfix
  - 🩹 `fix`: Simple fix for a non-critical issue
  - 💚 `fix`: Fix CI build
  - 🔥 `refactor`: Remove code or files

## Python-Specific Guidelines for Splitting Commits

When analyzing the diff for Python projects, consider splitting commits based on:

1. **Module separation**: Changes to different Python modules or packages
2. **Functionality**: Core logic vs tests vs documentation vs configuration
3. **Dependencies**: Adding/removing dependencies vs code changes
4. **Type annotations**: Adding type hints as separate commits
5. **Refactoring vs features**: Keep refactoring separate from new functionality
6. **Configuration changes**: pyproject.toml, pre-commit config, CI files
7. **Infrastructure**: Docker, deployment scripts, environment files

## Examples

Good Python commit messages:
- ✨ feat: add user authentication with JWT tokens
- 🐛 fix: resolve memory leak in data processing pipeline
- 📝 docs: add docstrings to core API functions
- ♻️ refactor: simplify error handling in database module
- 🚨 fix: resolve ruff linting warnings in models.py
- 🧑‍💻 chore: update pre-commit hooks configuration
- 🐍 feat: implement async context manager for database connections
- 🩹 fix: handle edge case in string parsing function
- 🚑️ fix: patch critical security vulnerability in auth middleware
- 🔍️ feat: add comprehensive type hints to API endpoints
- 🔥 refactor: remove deprecated utility functions
- 🦺 feat: add input validation for user registration
- 💚 fix: resolve failing pytest tests in CI
- 📊 feat: implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- 🔒️ feat: add rate limiting to API endpoints
- ➕ build: add pydantic dependency for data validation
- 🏷️ feat: add TypedDict definitions for API responses
- 🧪 test: add property-based tests with hypothesis
- 🌍 chore: update environment variables configuration

Example of splitting Python commits:
- First commit: ➕ build: add fastapi and uvicorn dependencies
- Second commit: ✨ feat: implement basic REST API endpoints
- Third commit: 🏷️ feat: add pydantic models for request validation
- Fourth commit: 📝 docs: add API documentation with examples
- Fifth commit: ✅ test: add unit tests for API endpoints
- Sixth commit: 🔧 chore: configure uvicorn for development
- Seventh commit: 🚨 fix: resolve bandit security warnings
- Eighth commit: 🐍 feat: add async database connection pooling

## Command Options

- `--no-verify`: Skip running the pre-commit checks and tests

## Important Notes

- By default, pre-commit hooks will run to ensure code quality and security
- If `uv run pytest` is configured, tests will be executed automatically
- If pre-commit checks fail, you'll be asked if you want to proceed or fix issues first
- Bandit security scanning will flag potential vulnerabilities
- Ruff will handle both linting and formatting automatically
- Commitizen hooks ensure your commit messages follow conventional format
- If specific files are already staged, the command will only commit those files
- If no files are staged, it will automatically stage all modified and new files
- The commit message will be constructed based on the Python-specific changes detected
- Before committing, the command will review the diff to identify if multiple commits would be more appropriate
- Always reviews the commit diff to ensure the message matches the changes

## UV-Specific Considerations

- **Dependencies**: Use `➕ build:` for adding dependencies via `uv add`
- **Lock file changes**: Separate `uv.lock` updates from code changes when possible
- **Virtual environment**: Commands run in uv-managed virtual environment
- **Build verification**: `uv build` ensures package configuration is valid
- **Script execution**: Use `uv run` prefix for Python scripts and tools
